Movie Analytics Using SQLite and Python

This project leverages Python and SQLite to analyze movie data. It provides insights into movie budgets, revenues, popularity, voting trends, and director performance, using advanced SQL queries and Python libraries for data manipulation and visualization.

Key Features:

1. Budget Analysis:

Identifies the top 10 highest-budget movies.

2. Revenue Analysis:

Lists the top 10 revenue-generating movies.

3. Voting Analysis:

Highlights the most popular movies based on the highest vote averages.

4. Director Insights:

Ranks directors by total revenue and number of movies directed.

Identifies the most prolific and bankable directors.

5. Specific Analysis:

Fetches movies directed by Steven Spielberg, sorted by vote averages.

Analyzes trends among female directors and their contributions.

6. Advanced Queries:

Extracts detailed insights using SQL queries on the movies and directors tables.

Technologies Used:

Python Libraries:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

NumPy: For numerical computations.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.

SQLite3: For database connectivity and SQL operations.

Database:

SQLite: movie.sqlite containing tables for movies and directors.

Getting Started:

Prerequisites:

Python 3.x

SQLite database file: movie.sqlite

Installation:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-analytics-using-sqlite.git

Install the required Python libraries:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn

Ensure the movie.sqlite database file is available in the specified directory.

Running the Project:

Execute the Python scripts to analyze and visualize the data.

Usage:

For Data Science Enthusiasts: Learn SQL integration with Python for advanced data analysis.

For Movie Enthusiasts: Explore interesting trends and insights about movies and directors.

For Beginner Analysts: Understand how to combine SQL and Python for querying and visualization.

File Structure:

main.py: Python script containing the analysis and visualization code.

movie.sqlite: SQLite database file with movie and director data.

README.md: Documentation for the project.

Future Enhancements:

Add interactive visualizations with tools like Plotly or Dash.

Expand analysis to include genres, regions, and year-wise trends.

Integrate a web-based interface for querying and visualizing the data.
